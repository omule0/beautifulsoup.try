	<h1>Web Scraping with Python and Beautiful Soup</h1>

	<p>In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Python and Beautiful Soup to scrape data from websites. Web scraping is the process of extracting information from websites and is a powerful tool for data analysis and research.</p>

	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Python 3.x</li>
		<li>Beautiful Soup</li>
		<li>Requests</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>To install Beautiful Soup and Requests, you can use pip, the Python package installer:</p>

	<pre><code>pip install beautifulsoup4 requests</code></pre>

	<h2>Scraping a Web Page</h2>
	<p>Here is an example Python script that uses Beautiful Soup to scrape data from a web page:</p>

	<pre><code>import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

title = soup.find('title').text
print(title)

links = soup.find_all('a')
for link in links:
    print(link.get('href'))</code></pre>

	<p>This script scrapes the Wikipedia page on web scraping and extracts the page title and all of the links on the page.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Web scraping is a powerful tool for data analysis and research, and Python and Beautiful Soup make it easy to extract data from websites. With just a few lines of code, you can scrape web pages and collect the data you need for your projects.</p>
